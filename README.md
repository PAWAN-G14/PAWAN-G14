- 👋 Hi, I’m @PAWAN-G14. (Born in Dec 2008, Tamil Nadu)
- 👀 I’m interested in Physics, Maths and Programming.
- 🪐 I’m currently learning the basics of linear algebra, calculus and kinematics.
- 🔧 Building little coding projects and pondering about something is my leisure activity.
- 🧪 At times, I experiment around with my learnings by simulating physics phenomenon.
- 📈 This habit helps me learn new stuff, solidifies my programming foundation, deepens my understanding of physics and problem-solving as well.
