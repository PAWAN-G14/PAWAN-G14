- 👋 Hi, I’m @PAWAN-G14, (Born in Dec 2008)
- 👀 I’m interested in Physics, Math and Programming
- 🪐 I’m currently learning the very basics of quantum mechanics, newtonian mechanics, linear algebra and differential calculus.
- 🤖 I'm also taking my first steps in learning the math behind ML & DL.
- 🧪 I like to play around by getting my hands dirty on simulating physics.
